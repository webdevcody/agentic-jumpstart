great, now break down this '/Users/webdevcody/Workspace/agentic-jumpstart/docs/f │
│ eatures/agents/requirements.md' file into smaller vertical slices I can work on │
│ using iterative development. create new markdown files inside the agents │
│ directory with a number prefixing the order which I should go through │
│ implementing them. describe the vertical slice and document at a high level how │
│ one might implement the feature with enough detail for a junior developer to be │
│ able to follow and implement.
